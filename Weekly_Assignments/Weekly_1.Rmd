# How to set up a GitHub web page in RStudio, a quick guide

### Installing R and RStudio

  * Installing R is pretty easy
    + Go to [cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and pick the correct mirror
      + They are organized by lanugage and then school
    + Pick a mirror and then pick the correct R dowload for your system 
    
    
  * Installing RStudio is also pretty simple!!!
    + Go to [https://posit.co/](https://posit.co/) and select the dowload RStudio in the top left hand corner
      + Note that RStudio has now been named posit so as to incorporate more programmers into using its IDE
    + Select the version for your operating system
      + Dowload and install
      
### Dowloading and Installing Git

  * Installing Git can be slightly more complicated
    + For Windows users
      + Proceed to [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
      + Dowload the correct version based on your system requirements
    + For Mac users
      + Proceed to [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)
      + Copy the code at the top of the page
        + `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
      + Open terminal and paste this code exactly into it
        + Follow the prompts
      + Once homebrew is installed, run `brew install git`
    + Once git is installed, restart RStudio
  * Trouble Shooting
    + For Mac users
      + Only the command lines from XCode should be needed to install homebrew
        + The Homebrew install process should autmatically download what it needs
        + However, during the install processes, errors can be thrown
        + If this is the case, download XCode from the app store, this should solve the issue
      + If running into further errors installing git, git can be installed via an installer
        + XCode will need to be first installed via the AppStore
        + Proceed to this [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/) to dowload the latest installer
        + After git is installed, XCodes user agreement needs to be approved
          + This can be done by either opening XCode from the desktop or via terminal in RStudio
        
### Creating a GitHub Account and Repository
  * Create a GitHub account
    + Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and select create an account
      + Follow the prompts
    + Then create a personal access token (this will be needed later to link your GitHub to RStudio)
      + Go to Developer settings
        + Personal access tokens
          + Generate “classic” token (name the token as you wish and pick a desired expiration date)
            + Gheck the “repo” box
              + Generate token
              + **Copy and paste token and save somewhere. You will not be able to see this code again**
      + Go to RStudio and run the following code in Console
        + `install.packages(“credentials”)`
          + follow prompts to install package
        + `git config –global user.email “put github email here” git config –global user.name “put your name here” credentials::set_github_pat(“put PAT here”)`
          + Run the next piece of code with your exact GitHub user name and then personal access token (PAT)
  * Create a new repository
    + Go to your home page and  click the “+”
      + Name the repository as desired
    + Include a
      + READme file
      + select MIT licence
      + Do not include gitignore
        + RStudio will generate this for us

### Linking R Project to GitHub and Hosting your Website
  * First in RStudio
    + In the very most top right corner, click on the dropdown and select New Project
    + Click “version control” and select “git”
      + If git is installed correctly, a check box should appear on this page
    + A box should appear asking for a URL
  * Then in your GitHub repository
    + Click on the green `CODE` button
    + Copy the URL
  * Back to RStudio
    + Paste the URl from GitHub into the prompted box
    + Name the repo the same as its named on GitHub
      + If not named exactly, problems will occur
    + Save this project to any location on computer
      + Note, do not save in downloads folder
    + Click `Create Project`
  * Back to GitHub
    + Go to your repoitory's settings
    + Go to pages select source
    + Change the selection from none to main branch

### Committing Changes to your Website
  * Now all wee need to do is create your page and update your GitHub
  * In RStudio
    + Create a new R markdown file title anything you want
    + Save the file as `index`
      + Important, must be a lower case i
    + Knit to html and save
  + Committing changes to GitHub
    + In RStudio, select the **terminal** and type the following commands in
      + `git status`
        + Checks the current status and see what is up to date with GitHub and not
      + `git add -A`
        + Add any changes to be submitted
      + `git commit -am ‘desired commit message’`
        + Adds a message for the commit
      + `git commit`
        + Commits the changes
      + `git push`
        + Pushs the changes up to GitHub
      + Note
        + Git status should be entered in between steps to make sure everything is proceeding
         ![](/Users/BenM/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/College/Bio/Reproducible R/Git Repository/BIOL1007A/Data/GitD.jpeg) 
  + Give it a few minutes than go to the link under your pages in setting
    + Your website should be live here, HOOOOORRRRAAAAYYYY!

### General Trouble Shooting
  * File size
    + Some files in the intall process are large
    + Make sure you have ample bandwidth and are not trying to install these larger items with multiple people at the same time, in the same space
  * GitHub hosting
    + It takes time for your GitHub webpage to live. Give it time.
